## Flywheel SDK

### Matlab toolbox Add-Ons toolbox

#### First installation

The SDK is installed as a Matlab toolbox managed using their 'Add-Ons' methods. You can do the installation with the scitran function from Matlab

    stFlywheelSDK('install');

That command downloads the toolbox from the web and installs it as an Add-On toolbox. You can verify that the toolbox was installed using

    stFlywheelSDK('verify')
    
    >   Name: 'flywheel-sdk'
    >   Version: '4.3.2'
    >   Guid: 'd2fd5657-1710-494e-b5e9-23903828bfb3'


### Upgrading

We anticipate new releases through 2018 and into 2019.  To install a new release, you should be able to call stFlywheelSDK with the 'uninstall' and then 'install' arguments. In certain cases, we have had to 'uninstall', restart Matlab, and then 'install'. 

    stFlywheelSDK('uninstall');   % This uninstalls the current version
    ...
    **RESTART MATLAB**
    ....
    stFlywheelSDK('install');   % The latest version changes over time. 

When running stFlywheelSDK, you may get some directions about removing directories from the Add-Ons directory.  Please follow those directions,

## Github repositories
You can install this scitranClient and another essential toolbox, Guillaume Flandin's code to read and write JSON files (JSONio) by 

    git clone https://github.com/vistasoft/scitran
    git clone https://github.com/gllmflndn/JSONio
    
This will create two directories, scitran and JSONio.  Please add both directories to your path, say by using

    chdir(<scitran directory>); addpath(genpath(pwd));
    chdir(<JSONio directory>); addpath(genpath(pwd));

## Flywheel SDK

### Matlab toolbox Add-Ons toolbox

The SDK is installed as a Matlab toolbox managed using their 'Add-Ons' methods. The installation is done once, and you can do the installation with the scitran function

    stFlywheelSDK('install');

That command downloads the toolbox from the web and installs it as an Add-On toolbox. You can verify or uninstall the toolbox using

    status = stFlywheelSDK('verify')
    status = stFlywheelSDK('uninstall')

If you are upgrading we suggest you uninstall, restart matlab, and then install.  We have done this sequence several times with success.  We haven't succeeded without the restart.

    stFlywheelSDK('uninstall');
    RESTART MATLAB
    stFlywheelSDK('install');

### SDK methods
The scitran methods (st.<TAB>) are a kinder, gentler interface to the SDK methods. If you want to use the SDK methods directly, the scitran object, st = scitran('stanfordlabs') makes them available through the fw slot. You can see the full list of methods by typing 

    st.fw.<TAB>

The list of SDK commands will show up as optional Matlab completions. 

This document tersely describes the [SDK methods](https://flywheel-io.github.io/core/branches/master/matlab/flywheel.api.html). The base wiki for [the SDK is here](https://flywheel-io.github.io/core/) 

The SDK is auto-generated into several different languages (Matlab, Python, and R).

## Flywheel command line interface (CLI)

We will write a stFlywheelCLI to install and invoke.  Hasn't happened yet.

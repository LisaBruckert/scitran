This page contains more detailed descriptions of the search parameters. To perform a search, first create a scitran Matlab object that is authorized to interact with your database (see [Authorization](Authorization)).  Then run

    st = scitran('vistalab');

You can search for a variety of different database objects.  The search returns a cell array of the database objects that match your query. Here is a list of objects you can search for.

    objects = {'file','acquisition','session','project','collection', 'analysis','subject','note'};

The general search syntax is
```
cellArray = st.search('<objectTypeToReturn>',...
               'Parameter',value, ...
                ...);
```
**cellArray** is a cell array of structures containing fields that are relevant to describe the database object.  For example, the cell array returned for a project is
```
>> projects{1}

ans = 

  struct with fields:

        project: [1×1 struct]
          group: [1×1 struct]
    permissions: [15×1 struct]
```
While the cell array for returned for a session is

```
>> sessions{1}

ans = 

  struct with fields:

        project: [1×1 struct]
          group: [1×1 struct]
        session: [1×1 struct]
        subject: [1×1 struct]
    permissions: [11×1 struct]
```
## Labels and names

Most objects can be described by a **label**.  There is one exception, however.  When we search for files we search on the **name**, not the **label**.

## Contains and matches exactly

When searching for some parameters, including label or name, you can ask that the object match the label exactly or that that label contains a string.   For example, on the vistalab site we have a project with the label 'VWFA' and several other projects that include 'VWFA' in the label.  

When we search for a project label 'VWFA', we assume an exact match.

```
>> projects = st.search('projects','project label','VWFA');
>> length(projects)
ans =
     1
>> projects{1}.source.label
ans =
    'VWFA'
```

It is possible to find all the projects that contain the string 'VWFA' as well.

```
>> projects = st.search('projects','project label contains','VWFA');
>> for ii=1:length(projects), disp(projects{ii}.source.label); end
VWFA
VWFA FOV
VWFA FOV Hebrew
```
The exact vs. contains options are also used for labels describing session, analysis, acquisition, collection, and the file **name**.

## Search examples

See the searches illustrated in [s_stSearches.m](https://github.com/scitran/client/blob/master/scripts/s_stSearches.m). Here are a few examples from that file.

```
projects = st.search('projects');
VWFAsessions = st.search('sessions','project label','VWFA');
    
files = st.search('files',...
    'collection label','Anatomy Male 45-55',...
    'acquisition label','Localizer',...
    'file type','nifti');

thisProject = 'ALDIT';
[sessions,srchCmd] = st.search('session',...
    'string','BOLD_EPI',...
    'project label exact',thisProject,...
    'summary',true);

[files,srchCmd] = st.search('file',...
    'session id',sessionID,...
    'summary',true);

% Sessions that are part of the GearTest collection
sessions = st.search('session',...
    'collection label exact','GearTest',...
    'summary',true);

%% Count the number of sessions created in a recent time period
sessions = st.search('session',...
    'session after time','now-16w',...
    'summary',true);

% Structs defining the group
groups = st.search('group','all');
disp(groups)

% Projects owned by a particular group
group = 'Wandell Lab';
[projects,srchCmd] = st.search('project',...
    'group label',group,...
    'summary',true);

% Analyses within a project
analyses = st.search('analysis',...
    'project label contains','VWFA FOV',...
    'summary',true);

```

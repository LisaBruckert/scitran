## Scitran Client

The scitran client software is part of our software tools to support scientific transparency.

The heart of the software is the scientific data management (SDM) software that includes a MongoDB database, a collection of tools to interact with the database (api), and a AngularJS front end to view, manage, and interact in many ways with the data.  The SDM components are [open-source code in the scitran repository](https://github.com/scitran)./

The SDM backend is being developed by [Flywheel Exchange](https://flyweel.io). They continue to extend the scitran data management functions, and they offer support for installation and maintenance.

This project, scitran client, provides a command line interface to the scitran database.  Flywheel and the Wandell lab at Stanford have added features to enable users to 

* search the database for files
* download the files for processing
* put the results and a description of the analysis back into the database.  

The scitran client includes both Matlab and Python code to support these functions.

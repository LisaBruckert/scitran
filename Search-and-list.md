### Listing vs. Searching

The scitran **list** method is useful when you know the ID of a container (project, session, acquisition or collection) and you want to list what is within it. The [list examples page](list-examples) demonstrates the usage.  One way to understand the information returned from a list or search is to explore the values in the returned Matlab structs.  You also might want to look at the [Flywheel data model](https://github.com/scitran/core/wiki/Data-Model) to see the definition of a term.

The scitran **search** method is useful when you are planning to find and analyze data from existing projects. The scitran **search** method returns a great deal of information about the file or container. To learn more about setting search parameter see [search examples on this page](search-examples) and an [m-file with many examples](https://github.com/scitran/client/blob/master/scripts/s_stSearches.m). 

If you know what you want and where it is, use **list**.  If you are exploring, use **search**.

### Brief introduction to search
The arguments to the search method specify (a) the type of object to return and (b) parameters that define the search. For example, to search for all the projects in the database you would use

    projects = st.search('project');

The first argument is a required string that defines the type of object you would like returned. The permissible strings are
```
'project','session','acquisition','file','collection', 'analysis','subject','note'
```

The other search parameters are in parameter/val format.  For example, to find a project with a particular label (case sensitive) use
```
vwfaProject = st.search(...
                'project',...
                'project label exact','VWFA');
```
or to find all the sessions in a specific project 
```
vwfaSessions = st.search(...
                 'session',...
                 'project label exact','VWFA');
```
To find partial label matches (case insensitive) use
```
project = st.search(...
             'project',
             'project label contains','vwfa');
```

## Search scope

By default, you search only the projects you have access to.  To search the entire database use argument

    projects = st.search('project','all_data',true);

You only have permission to view or download a subset of these, but you can learn about what is in the database from an 'all_data' search.

## Technical points

### Search implementation
The search method uses **elastic search**, an advanced method for searching large databases.  Elastic search is constantly indexing the data base, and the search is based on this index. For this reason, there may be some delay between the time when you modify the MongoDB itself, and when you can find the modification using elastic search. Typically, the time is fairly short - a few seconds or so. 

### Formats
The data format returned by the **list** method differs from the data returned by the **search** method.  A great deal more metadata is returned by search.

### Downloading
To download a container or a file, or to get metadata about them, use the **download**<> and **get**<> methods. To download a file use the **downloadFile** or **read** method.

Searching a Flywheel database is very useful when you are processing data or searching to reuse data from many projects. The scitran **search** method returns a great deal of information about the object, but not the object itself. To get either the whole object or values from the object use one of the get<>, download<> or read<> methods.

There are many search parameters. To learn more about these see [search examples on this page](search-examples) and an [m-file with many examples](https://github.com/scitran/client/blob/master/scripts/s_stSearches.m).

The scitran **listObjects** method is designed for the case when you know the ID of an object (project, session, acquisition or collection) and you want to list what is within that object. The [list examples page](list-examples) demonstrates the usage. 
**N.B.**  The structs returned by the **listObjects** method differs from the structs returned by the **search** method.  

One way to understand the information returned in a search is to explore the values in the returned Matlab structs.  You also might want to look at the [Flywheel data model](https://github.com/scitran/core/wiki/Data-Model) to see the definition of a term.

### Brief introduction
The arguments to the search method specify (a) the type of object to return and (b) parameters that define the search. For example, to search for all the projects in the database you would use

    projects = st.search('project');

The first argument is a required string that defines the type of object you would like returned. The permissible strings are
```
'project','session','acquisition','file','collection', 'analysis','subject','note'
```

The other search parameters are in parameter/val format.  For example, to find a project with a particular label (case sensitive) use
```
vwfaProject = st.search(...
                'project',...
                'project label exact','VWFA');
```
or to find all the sessions in a specific project 
```
vwfaSessions = st.search(...
                 'session',...
                 'project label exact','VWFA');
```
To find partial label matches (case insensitive) use
```
project = st.search(...
             'project',
             'project label contains','vwfa');
```

## Search scope

By default, you search only the projects you have access to.  To search the entire database use argument

    projects = st.search('project','all_data',true);

You only have permission to view or download a subset of these, but you can learn about what is in the database from an 'all_data' search.

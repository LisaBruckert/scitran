This whole wiki and toolbox is about supporting 'Own programming' for Matlab users.

There is support for other languages (Python and R) at the Flywheel SDK.  This type of wrapper has not been attended to for Python or R, however.  But some wrapping in Python.

We know many people use GitHub.  Use too.  So we have tools to simplify toolbox installation from the GitHub site.

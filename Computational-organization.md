***
We separate Flywheel computing into two types.  One type involves executes programs that are installed in the user's system (e.g., FSL, Freesurfer, and dcm2niix). These programs are run by specifying input files and parameters. In addition, many users write their own code. They use a variety of languages (Python, Matlab, R, bash scripts). These users can obtain authorization to read and edit Flywheel data and metadata.

Flywheel supports both types of computation.  Configuring and invoking an existing program is called running a **Gear**.  When a user writes their own program, they interact with Flywheel using the Software Development Kit (**SDK**).

**Scitran** is a Matlab wrapper on the **SDK**. The **SDK** includes methods to invoke **Gears** and monitor their progress, providing command line control of the **Gears**.

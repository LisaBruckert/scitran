Flywheel recognizes two types of computing.  
* Many users execute programs that are installed in the user's system (e.g., FSL, Freesurfer, and dcm2niix). These programs are run by specifying input files and parameters. 
* In addition, some users develop their **own code** in Python, Matlab, R, or bash scripts. These users need tools to obtain authorization to read and edit Flywheel data and metadata, and to store the results of their analyses

Flywheel supports both types of computation.  Configuring and invoking an existing program is called running a **Gear**.  When a user writes their own program, they interact with Flywheel using the Software Development Kit (**SDK**).

**Scitran** is a Matlab wrapper on the **SDK**. The **SDK** includes methods to invoke **Gears** and monitor their progress, providing command line control of **Gears**. It also has methods for authorizing the user to read and write to the Flywheel system.

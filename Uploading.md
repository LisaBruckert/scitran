NOTES.  This should be about st.upload and st.create methods.

## Uploading

### Create a project

    st.create(); 

## Analysis upload

Create an analysis and upload it to an Analysis tab
s_stGears.m line

### Example

Create a data structure and put it (upload) to the site.

Should we make an analysis object with its own create, put, get? Check how this would work with the code in s_stGears.m

## Uploading

### Create a project

    @scitran.create(); 

### Example

Create a data structure and put it (upload) to the site.

https://github.com/vistalab/Newsome--Kiani-2014-CurrentBiology/blob/master/upload_data.m

Should we make an analysis object with its own create, put, get? Check how this would work with the code in s_stGears.m

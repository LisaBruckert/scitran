There are two principal classes in the client toolbox.  The **scitran** class and the **toolboxes** class.  The scitran class, described here, is designed to interact with the contents of the Flywheel database.  The toolboxes class is described in a separate page.  It is designed to help you reproduce Matlab computations with Flywheel data.

The scitran object has an expanding and evolving number of methods. This page describes those methods, and we plan to update this information regularly.

The scitran class includes the URL of the Flywheel database, the name of the instance, and the Flywheel SDK class that communicates with the database.  Not shown is the information that authorizes you to see your portion of the database.

```
>> st = scitran('vistalab')

st = 

  scitran with properties:

         url: 'https://vistalab.flywheel.io'
    instance: 'vistalab'
          fw: [1Ã—1 Flywheel]
```

The scitran methods help you identify the contents of the database (search), get information about these objects (e.g., getfileinfo), download and read files stored in the data base.

In addition, there are methods to download a project, session, acquisition, or collection.  A project can be downloaded in the format of a [BIDS directory](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).



### search
Find projects, sessions, acquisitions, collections, files, subjects constrained by many possible limits (file type, label, date...).  This is big.

### get
Information about files or database objects

### download and read
A database object (A zip file of a project, session, acquisition, or a file) is brought to your local computer ('download').  In some cases (e.g., a nifti file), the file is first downloaded and then automatically read into a Matlab variable ('read').  

### projectHierarchy
A listing of the sessions and acquisitions in a project hierarchy

### bids download/upload
Download or upload a BIDS directory tree

### create
Create a project or a session or an acquistion

### put, or putAnalysis
Files, analyses, ...

### update
Database values (e.g., subject code, sex ...)

### runFunction
Download toolboxes and run a function from a remote site

### browser
Bring up a browser to a location

### deleteProject

## TOOLBOXES class methods
The main @toolboxes methods are install and clone.  In addition there are ().

### install
Read a toolbox.json file and get a zip archive, put it on path

### clone
Clone a a git repository and add it to your path.  cloneDepth allowed.

## BIDS class methods

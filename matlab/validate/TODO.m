%% Validation scripts we hope to write
%
% The scitranClient utilities are designed to interact with the scitran API
% that manages MR and related neuroimaging data.
%
% The utlities require user authentication to interact with the database.
% The basic capabilities we plan are simply for
%
%    * Search
%    * Download
%    * Upload
%
% We wil build utilities on top of those capabilities over time.
% What will be returned will be a mix of URLs to the data or in some cases
% the data themselves.
% The search will extend (a) through MongoDB only? or (b) through the
% Elastic search capabilities.
%
% Examples
%   Return all the diffusion scans for males between 12 and 15 years of age
%   Return the T1 scans for people in the ADNI project

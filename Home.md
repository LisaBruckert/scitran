The **scitran matlab client** enables Matlab users to interact with a [Flywheel data and computation system](https://flywheel.io). The client methods search, list, upload, download, read and analyze Flywheel data and metadata.  The client can control job scheduling. 

The **scitran matlab client** can be run securely from any computer on the Internet. We have used the client extensively on Mac and Linux systems.

This wiki describes the software and explains how to

* obtain authorization to interact with a Flywheel database
* list and search the database contents
* download and read database objects (e.g., files, sessions, projects, analyses)
* upload files, notes, and attachments (e.g., files, graphs, metadata)
* upload analyses and software (e.g., Matlab files) for computational sharing

This client is part of our vision of using Flywheel to create a reproducible research paper that shares both data and computations. 

See the [Stanford Project on Scientific Transparency (PoST)](http://post.stanford.edu) for an overview of our goals.

### Related information

This client relies on the [Flywheel SDK](Flywheel-SDK) a platform independent set of functions that are written in [Golang](https://golang.org/).  This client calls the Flywheel SDK functions from Matlab. The same Flywheel SDK is used by [**a scitran python client**](https://github.com/scitran/python-client) and a **scitran** 'R' client.

The **scitran matlab client** enables Matlab users to interact with a [Flywheel system](https://flywheel.io). The client methods search, list, upload, download, read and analyze Flywheel data and metadata.  The client can control job scheduling. 

The **scitran matlab client** can be run securely from any computer on the Internet. We have used the client extensively on Mac and Linux systems.

This wiki describes the software and explains how to

* obtain authorization to interact with a Flywheel database
* search the database
* get information about the database contents
* download or read database objects (e.g., files, sessions, projects, analyses)
* upload files to the database (e.g., files, graphs, other attachments)
* upload data analyses and software (e.g., Matlab files) that others can run

This client is part of our vision of how to work with Flywheel to create a reproducible paper, accounting for both data and computation. 

### Related information

This client interacts with Flywheel using the [Flywheel SDK](Flywheel-SDK) a platform independent set of functions that are written in [Golang](https://golang.org/).  The Flywheel SDK functions are in a library that is called from Matlab. The scitran matlab client accesses the Flywheel SDK for many basic utilities.

The same Flywheel SDK is also exported into libraries for [**a scitran python client**](https://github.com/scitran/python-client) and a **scitran** 'R' client.

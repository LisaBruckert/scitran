The **scitran matlab client** enables Matlab users to compute with a [Flywheel data and computation system](https://flywheel.io). The client methods help you search, upload, download, read and analyze Flywheel data and metadata. The client also schedules and controls jobs (Gears). 

The **scitran matlab client** can be run securely from any computer on the Internet. We have used the client extensively on Mac and Linux systems.

This wiki has a conceptual overview of Flywheel and then explanations on how to

* obtain authorization and connect with a Flywheel database
* list and search the database contents (files, metadata, and jobs)
* download and read database objects (e.g., files, sessions, projects, analyses)
* upload files, notes, and attachments (e.g., files, graphs, metadata)
* upload analyses and software (e.g., Matlab files) for computational sharing

This client and Flywheel are part of our vision to create a work environment that supports sharing data and computations, and leading to better reproducible research for publication. See the [Stanford Project on Scientific Transparency (PoST)](http://post.stanford.edu) for an overview of our goals.

### Related information

This client relies on the [Flywheel SDK](Flywheel-SDK) a platform independent set of functions.  This client calls the Flywheel SDK functions from Matlab. The same Flywheel SDK is used by [**a scitran python client**](https://github.com/scitran/python-client) and a **scitran** 'R' client.

The **scitran matlab client** provides tools so that Matlab users can interact with the a scitran database. The main use is to read and analyze data from a [Flywheel](https://flywheel.io) implementation of the scitran data and computational management system.

The **scitran matlab client** can be run securely from any computer on the Internet. We have used the client extensively on Mac and Linux systems.  We have not tested extensively on Windows systems yet, but at least it seems to run.

This wiki describes the software and provides examples including how to

* obtain authorization to interact with a Flywheel database
* search the database for its contents
* get information about the database contents
* download or read database objects (e.g., files, sessions, projects, analyses)
* upload files to the database (e.g., files, graphs, other attachments)
* upload method descriptions (e.g., analyses, Gears) and programs (e.g., Matlab files) that others can run
* paper of the future (pof) efforts

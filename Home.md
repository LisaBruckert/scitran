The **scitran client** repository implements a command line interface to allow users to interact with the scitran database from their own computers.  Specifically, [Flywheel](https://flywheel.io) and the [Wandell lab at Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/~wandell) have added features to enable users to perform the following functions

* obtain authorization to read/write from a Flywheel database
* search the database
* download database objects (e.g., files, sessions, projects, analyses)
* upload results (e.g., files, graphs, other attachments)
* upload method descriptions (e.g., analyses, Gears)

The scitran client can be run securely from any computer on the Internet. In this way, a user can process data stored in a scitran database either using their local computer or from a larger computational resource such as a compute engine on the cloud.

The key elements that supports **reproducible research** are these
  * The original files are securely stored in a database
  * The analysis methods are implemented reproducibly (using [Gears](https://github.com/scitran/client/wiki/Gears)), and 
  * The results and analysis specification are stored back in the database. 

The **scitran client** will include implementations in both Matlab and Python.  The client will include examples of how to reproducibly run many standard functions from FSL, FreeSurfer, SPM, and other packages.

The Wandell lab gratefully acknowledge the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/) and particularly the [Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative](https://sfari.org/) for their support of the [Project on Scientific Transparency] (http://post.stanford.edu).  The code in this repository and the api functionality are being developed by Michael Perry, Renzo Frigato, Gunnar Schaefer, and Brian Wandell.

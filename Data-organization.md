## Data Containers (version 5.0.4 and later)
The Flywheel database hierarchy matches a neuroimaging project. The top level is the user's group;  a group typically contains multiple Projects; each project contains multiple Sessions; each session contains multiple Acquisitions; each acquisition contains multiple Files.

The containers are Matlab **objects**.  Each object includes metadata about a Flywheel object, and has methods that perform useful functions. For example, you can 

* Display the container's metadata
* Update metadata
* Download or upload content from within the container (e.g., Files, Sessions, Acquisitions)

There are many [SDK methods](https://flywheel-io.github.io/core/branches/master/matlab/flywheel.html#flywheel-class), and one purpose of scitran is to simplify using these methods. 

This simple illustration uses a Project to find the files.
```
project = st.lookup('adni/ADNI: T1');
adniProjectFiles = project.files;
stPrint(adniProjectFiles,'name')

Entry: name.

```

You can also call the Flywheel methods directly because they are part of the scitran object.  Specifically, all the methods are available from scitran.fw.<>.

### Methods
The scitran object methods help you perform many simple actions. For example

    scitran.lookup('a string')  - Returns metadata about a container
    scitran.search( ... )       - Searches the database for specific types of metadata

Actions on containers and files can be found using Matlab TAB-completion:

    scitran.container<TAB> - Shows all the basic Data Container methods
    scitran.file<TAB>      - Shows all the basic File methods 
    scitran.<TAB>          - Shows all the scitran methods

One additional data container type, the **Collection**, is described below. Other objects (Analyses, Gears, and Jobs) are described in the [Computational organization section](Computational-organization).  Most of these containers can include Files.

### Notes, tags and attachments

We use the term **info** to refer the metadata. There are methods to read and modify the Flywheel Info fields.

    st.infoGet - Read metadata from a container or file
    st.infoSet - Write metadata on a container or file

Info is organized into various types: **notes, tags, and attachments**.  These are all metadata, but it is useful to have distinguish between certain types of information. You can set notes, tags and attachments with the info* methods.

### Virtual projects:  Collections
To reuse data we create a new data container, the **Collection**. A Collection includes a subset of the sessions, acquisitions that the user selects from the database.  In the user interface, a Collection looks like a Project.  A Collection as a virtual project based on data reuse.  

**Scitran** has methods to create and delete Collections.  These can be found using

    scitran.collection<TAB>

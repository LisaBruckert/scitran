function  eraseProject(obj, projectID)
% remove a project completely
%
%    st.eraseProject('projectId')
%
% uses the projectHierarchy method to build the hierarchy of
% project,sessions and acquisitions that will be deleted.
%
%% WARNING WARNING WARNING
%  Unfortunately there is no proper testing yet for this method.
%  Therefore a bug could be destructive. 
%  It is IMPORTANT to verify the number of acquisitions sessions and the
%  project that we are deleting.
%  possible bugs could originate from the
%  scitran.projectHierarchy dependency or in the search results retrieved 
%  by this method.
%  More subtle bugs could be related to the JSON library we are using.
%  If, for example the 'x0x5F_id', is not converted to '_id' in the JSON 
%  sent to the API

* Scitran data management methods enable you to find database contents, including both data and metadata. There are also methods to download and upload files, and modify metadata, and create collections. See the [Conceptual overview](conceptual-overview) and [Flywheel data model](Flywheel-data-model) pages to learn about the organization of Flywheel data and metadata. 

* These wiki pages are an introduction to the scitran methods. It is difficult to keep these pages absolutely up-to-date. We do try to keep the comments in the file up-to-date.  Thus, we encourage you to use the Matlab help and doc methods to bring up the current information in the method, say

    doc scitran.MethodName, or 
    help scitran.MethodName
    doc scitran.verify          % An example

To see examples of usage, use

    stExamplesShow(FUNCTION_NAME);              % Syntax
    stExamplesShow('scitran.containerUpload');  % An example

As the methods stabilize, we will put more information into this wiki, or perhaps some more advanced manual system provided by the Flywheel team.

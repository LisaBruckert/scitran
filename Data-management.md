Scitran data management methods enable you to find database contents, get information about these objects, download and upload files, and modify metadata. See the [Flywheel terms](Flywheel-terms) page to learn about the conceptual organization of Flywheel data.

Usage details of these methods are provided in other wiki pages and from the code itself. We encourage you to type help or doc to bring up the current information in the method, say

    doc scitran.MethodName

As the methods input and return parameters stabilize, we will put more information in the wiki. Here is a link to a [list of scitran methods](scitran-methods) that we are trying to keep updated.

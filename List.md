The scitran **list** method is useful when you know the containers (project, session, acquisition or collection), and you want to list the container content. The list command returns a cell array, and each cell has the type of the object that you are listing.  For example, listing the sessions in a project returns a cell array of objects in the class _flywheel.model.Session_.

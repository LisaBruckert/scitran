The list method returns metadata about containers or files when the parent container is already known.  This is similar to the search method, but in that case the containers and files do not have a single parent, or the parent is not known.

The setFileInfo method edits the metadata in the Information field of a file.

The **getdicominfo** example reads file-specific metadata.

The other routines for getting metadata about subjects need to be documented here.

The corresponding modify routines should be documented here.

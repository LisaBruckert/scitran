## Docker

You may want to run docker containers, which requires that you have Docker installed on your local machine. To do that visit the docker website for [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/) instructions.

To set up the Docker configuration to run from Matlab on your computer, use the command [matlab/stDockerConfig.m](https://github.com/scitran/client/blob/master/utility/stDockerConfig.m).

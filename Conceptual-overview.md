The [Data organization](Data-organization) and [Computational organization](Computational-organization) pages describe the principles behind the Flywheel data and computations.  These principles are important to understand for using the **scitran** and **Flywheel SDK** methods. 

Those pages are intentionally short, providing a conceptual overview so you understand the software design principles. Over time we will add links to more help and examples to both of those pages as well as a list of related sites to this page.

This page describes general principles of the **scitran** and **Flywheel SDK** methods. It is intentionally short to provide a conceptual overview before you program with these tools.

First we describe the Flywheel data management. Then we describe tools for reproducible computations.  This page will stay short, but over time we will add links to more help and examples.  


## Flywheel computations
We talk about analyses and the toolbox class.

The [analysis methods](Toolboxes) support reproducible computation, such as interactions with github repositories.

We describe jobs.

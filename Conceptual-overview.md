There are two principal types of methods in the scitran Matlab client: The **data management** methods and the **analysis** methods.  The [data management](data-management) methods facilitate interactions with Flywheel data.  The [analysis methods](Toolboxes) support reproducible computation, such as interactions with github repositories.

We describe the idea of a container informally.  We link to the more detailed flywheel data model page.

We describe the idea of metadata.

We talk about analyses and the toolbox class.

We describe notes.

We describe jobs.

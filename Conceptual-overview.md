The [Data organization](Data organization) and [Computational organization](Computational organization) pages describe the general principles of the **scitran** and **Flywheel SDK** methods. These pages are intentionally short to provide a conceptual overview before you program with these tools.

Over time we will add links to more help and examples to both of those pages as well as a list of related sites to this page.

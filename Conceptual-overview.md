The [Data organization](Data-organization) and [Computational organization](Computational-organization) pages describe the general principles of the **scitran** and **Flywheel SDK** methods. Those pages are intentionally short, providing a conceptual overview so you understand the software design principles.

Over time we will add links to more help and examples to both of those pages as well as a list of related sites to this page.

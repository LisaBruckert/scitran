A [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) directory can be uploaded to Flywheel using the scitran method **bidsUpload**.  A Flywheel project created by uploading from a BIDS directory can be downloaded using the scitran methods **bidsDownload**.  The scitran methods and **bids** class are described here.

## Constructing a BIDS object

If you have a BIDS data directory (bDir), we you can build a description of the directory using

    thisBIDS = bids(bDir)

We expect that bDir is a directory on your computer that contains a BIDS formatted directory tree.  The bids() constructor scans the directory and returns a bids object containing all the BIDS directories, metadata files and imaging data files. You can validate the BIDS compliance using

    thisBIDS.validate

Directory names in the bids object are stored relative to the home of the data directory.

## Uploading
You can upload the BIDS data using these Matlab commands.  The example points to a directory on my disk (fw_test) that contains a BIDS directory tree.  I upload the data to a project assigned to my group (BIDSup).

```
data = bids(fullfile(stRootPath,'local','BIDS-examples','fw_test'));
data.projectLabel = 'BIDSUpload';
groupLabel = 'Wandell Lab'; 
project = st.bidsUpload(data,groupLabel);
```

The metadata that are uploaded all have the string 'bids@' prepended to them.  I am not sure this is necessary, but I do it now anticipating that it will be helpful when we do the **bidsDownload** method.

## Downloading

This method has not yet been converted to the new SDK calls. That will be next weekend's project.

     projectLabel = 'The FW project label'
     bidsDir = st.bidsDownload(projectLabel,'destination',<destination directory>);

## Notes

* We are creating API methods to validate that a Flywheel project has the necessary BIDS information and can be downloaded as a BIDS directory.
* Several BIDS applications (fMRIprep and XXX) are implemented as Gears on Flywheel.
* There is a **Python** method for uploading and downloading.

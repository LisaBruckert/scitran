The scitran **list** method returns the metadata for a specific container (project, session, acquisition, analysis or collection) 

This **list** method returns metadata about the container contents. The **downloadFile** and **downloadContainer** methods retrieve the data themselves. The **search** method returns containers or files from the whole database.

## Data format

The data returned by **list** has a different format from the data returned by **search**.  There is a reason - but I have no intention of defending this behavior!  I am considering what to do about this.

## Examples

Suppose you want a list describing the sessions in a particular project.
```
project      = st.search('project','project label exact','VWFA');
projectID    = idGet(project{1});
sessions     = st.list('session',projectID);
```
Or suppose you want to find the projects within a particular group

    projects     = st.list('project','wandell');

Be aware that the cell array returned by listObjects differs from that returned by search.  In the **listObject** case the projectID is found by projects{1}.id, rather than projects{1}.project.x_id.  You can reduce your programming burden by calling the utility function idGet(...), which returns a container id for either format.

    sessions     = st.list('session',idGet(projects{1}));

Continuing down the directory tree, 

    acquisitions = st.list('acquisition',idGet(sessions{3})); 
    files        = st.list('file',idGet(acquisitions{1}));

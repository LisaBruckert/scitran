To access a scitran database, we create a scitran object

    st = scitran(varargin)

To see the options, type

    doc scitran

The principal options are to 'create', 'refresh', or 'revoke' authorization to a specific instance.  A typical example of gaining access is

    st.auth('action', 'create', 'instance', 'scitran');

The authorization token is generated by running python code (see url below). The code opens a browser where the user is prompted to enter their Google credentials.  This is the authorization mechanisms used by scitran sites. In addition, there are several configuration steps that may be needed the very first time you use scitran client in a session on your computer.  These initializations for the PATH configuration are managed here by the 'init' flag. 

    st.auth('action', 'create', 'instance', 'scitran', 'init',{true/false});

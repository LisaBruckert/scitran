We create a Matlab scitran object to interact with the database

    st = scitran(name, varargin)

The first time you run scitran for a site name, you will be queried for the site URL and the API Key.  This information will be stored on your computer for future reference.

The URL for the vistalab site is https://flywheel.scitran.stanford.edu.  You can find an API Key for your account on your site within the user profile tab on the user profile page.  

### An example
```
st = scitran('vistalab','action','create')
Please enter the url (https://...): https://flywheel.scitran.stanford.edu
Please enter the API key: <long API Key obtained on the flywheel site>
API key saved for vistalab.
```

### Usage examples 

If you already have the client configured, you can simply type

    st = scitran('vistalab');

To remove the site 

    st = scitran('vistalab','action','remove');

To refresh the API Key, obtain the new key on the site and then run

    st = scitran('vistalab','action','refresh');

To verify that the scitran object is correctly connecting to the site type

    st = scitran('vistalab','verify',true);   % Should print your projects
    % Open the browser to verify that the URL and your ID are correct
    st.browser;

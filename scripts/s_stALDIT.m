%% ALDIT data set error analysis (phantom data)
%
% This is an example. We find an acquisition, download the DWI data, and do
% something reasonable with it.  This graph can be compared with graphs
% from other phantom measurements on other scanenrs.
%
% TODO
%  @LMP - We could add info to the plots about the data, project label and
%  subject, but perhaps other things.  Also, we could standardize a bit
%  more on the look of the graphs.
%
%  This code assumes vistasoft and scitranClient are installed.  We should
%  write a wrapper at the front to make sure this is true.  Good use of
%  stbuse, but that is too damn complicated right now.
%
%  Deal with the github ISSUE about the acquisition labels and number of
%  bvec files.

The Matlab scitran client is designed to be a simple interface to the wide array of endpoints available in the Flywheel SDK.  

## Installing the SDK

We suggest you use the stFlywheelSDK command shown on the [Installation](Installation) page. That command downloads a matlab toolbox that is installed in the Add-Ons directory.

When you create the scitran object, st = scitran('stanfordlabs'); the Flywheel SDK methods are accessed 

     st.fw.<API-Commands>

Here is a document tersely describing the [api calls](https://flywheel-io.github.io/core/branches/master/matlab/flywheel.api.html)

And the [base wiki ](https://flywheel-io.github.io/core/)
       
The SDK is auto-generated and available for several languages (Matlab, Python, and R) as part of the Flywheel SDK.
